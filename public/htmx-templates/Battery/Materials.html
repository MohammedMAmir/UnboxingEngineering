<p class="c7">
 <span class="c6">
  Materials scientists are at the forefront of researching and developing new materials for batteries that are
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  more efficient, durable, and environmentally friendly
 </span>
 <span class="c6">
  . They explore novel materials for electrodes and electrolytes that can store more energy per unit mass, leading to
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  lighter and smaller batteries with higher capacities
 </span>
 <span class="c6">
  . This includes investigating
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  solid-state electrolytes
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  , which could significantly improve battery safety and energy density.

 <span class="c1">
  effectively dissipate heat
 </span>
 <span class="c6">
  generated during charging and discharging,
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  preventing overheating and potential thermal runaway
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  . This contributes to the battery's safety, performance, and longevity, ensuring it remains stable and efficient even under high load conditions.
