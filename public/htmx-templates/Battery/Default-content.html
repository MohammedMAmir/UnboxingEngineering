<div>Lithium-Ion Battery:<br>The iPhone
12 uses a type of battery called "lithium-ion." This kind of battery is 
commonly used in many electronic devices because it's lightweight, has a 
high energy density (stores a lot of energy in a small space), and can be 
recharged.<br><br>
How it Works: <br>
Inside the battery,
there are two types of materials called electrodesâ€”one is positive (cathode), 
and the other is negative (anode).<br><br>
Between these electrodes is an electrolyte, a substance that allows ions 
(charged particles) to move between the positive and negative sides.<br><br>
When you use your iPhone, it draws electrical power from the battery. This 
causes the lithium ions in the anode to move through the electrolyte to the 
cathode, creating an electric current that powers your device.</div>
