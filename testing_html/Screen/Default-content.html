  Display Technology
 </span>
</h3>
<p class="c1">
 <span class="c12">
  The iPhone utilizes advanced display technologies such as
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  in earlier models and
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED)
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  in more recent versions. OLED technology, in particular,
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  offers superior contrast, more vibrant colors, and deeper blacks
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  compared to LCD because each pixel emits its own light, eliminating the need for a backlight. This not only improves visual quality but also contributes to making the device
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  thinner
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  and
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  more energy-efficient
 </span>
 <span class="c7">
  .

  Touchscreen Interface
 </span>
</h3>
<p class="c1">
 <span class="c12">
  The
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  touchscreen functionality
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  is integrated into the display, allowing users to interact directly with what's on the screen. This is achieved through a
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  capacitive touchscreen layer
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  that
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  detects touch by the electrical properties of the human body
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  . When a user touches the screen,
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  a small electrical charge is disrupted at the point of contact
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  , allowing the phone to determine the location of the touch. Advanced
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  algorithms
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  then interpret these touches as gestures—such as
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  taps, swipes, and pinches
 </span>
 <span class="c7">
  —which are used to control the device.
 </span>

  Durability and Sensitivity Enhancements
 </span>
</h3>
<p class="c1">
 <span class="c12">
  To enhance durability, the iPhone's screen is made from
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  specially treated glass
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  that is
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  resistant to scratches and impacts
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  . Some models feature glass that has been
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  chemically strengthened
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  , such as Apple's proprietary "Ceramic Shield," which is touted as having 4x better drop performance. Additionally, the screen is coated with an
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  oleophobic (oil-repellent) layer
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  to help
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  reduce fingerprints and smudges
 </span>
 <span class="c7">
  , maintaining clarity and touch sensitivity.

  Integration with Software
 </span>
</h3>
<p class="c1">
 <span class="c12">
  The screen's functionality is deeply integrated with
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  iOS, Apple's mobile operating system
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  , allowing for an intuitive user experience. The
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  software
 </span>
 <span class="c12">
  is designed to respond fluidly to the
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  user's gestures, with animations and transitions
 </span>
 <span class="c7">
  that make the interaction feel natural.
