  The chassis of an iPhone serves as the structural frame that supports and houses all internal components, including the motherboard, display, battery, and camera modules. It is engineered to provide strength and rigidity, protecting the device from physical stresses and impacts while maintaining a lightweight and aesthetically pleasing design. The development of the iPhone's chassis focuses on material selection, precision engineering, and integration of design elements that enhance the device's durability, ergonomics, and wireless signal reception.

 <span class="c7">
  The chassis is designed to distribute and absorb forces encountered during everyday use, such as drops or pressure, preventing damage to the internal components. It also provides mounting points for internal components, ensuring precise alignment and secure attachment. The chassis is engineered to facilitate efficient thermal management, aiding in heat dissipation from high-performance components. Additionally, it is designed with considerations for antenna placement and performance, ensuring optimal wireless connectivity by minimizing signal interference.
