  In addition to material development, chemical engineers are instrumental in developing
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  specialized coatings for camera lenses
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  . These coatings are designed to
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  enhance light transmission, reduce reflections, and minimize lens flare
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  , improving the overall image quality. They also work on
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  hydrophobic and oleophobic coatings
 </span>
 <span class="c8 c3">
  that repel water and oils, keeping the lens cleaner and ensuring consistent photo quality even with frequent handling.
