 <span class="c1">
  image sensor
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  and the associated
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  processing circuits
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  . They ensure that the
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  sensor accurately captures light
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  and
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  converts it into digital signals
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  , which are then processed to produce high-quality images. Their work involves optimizing
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  sensor sensitivity, noise reduction, and dynamic range
 </span>
 <span class="c8 c3">
  to enhance low-light performance and image detail.

 <span class="c3">
  Electrical engineers also contribute to the development of
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  autofocus and optical image stabilization systems,
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  which are critical for capturing clear images and videos. They design
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  the circuitry and control algorithms
 </span>
 <span class="c8 c3">
  that adjust the lens position rapidly and accurately in response to changes in the scene or camera movement. This technology is essential for maintaining sharp focus and stable images, especially in dynamic or challenging shooting conditions.
