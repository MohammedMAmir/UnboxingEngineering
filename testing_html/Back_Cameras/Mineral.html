<p class="c5">
 <span class="c3">
  Mineral engineers are also involved in managing the
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  supply chain for the critical minerals
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  needed for the camera's components. They work on
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  optimizing the extraction, processing, and transportation of these materials
 </span>
 <span class="c8 c3">
  , ensuring a steady and responsible supply. Their expertise helps in mitigating risks associated with resource scarcity, geopolitical issues, or environmental concerns, thereby ensuring the continuous production of iPhone cameras without interruptions.
