  The vibration motor in an iPhone, often referred to as the "Taptic Engine," is a component designed to provide haptic feedback to the user. This feedback comes in the form of subtle vibrations that simulate the feel of real-life touches, clicks, or movements, enhancing the user experience by providing tactile responses to touch inputs. The development of the vibration motor focuses on creating precise, responsive, and varied haptic effects while maintaining energy efficiency and minimizing noise.

  How It Works

  The vibration motor operates by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, causing the device to vibrate. In the case of the Taptic Engine, Apple uses a linear actuator, which moves a small mass back and forth very quickly to create vibration. Unlike traditional rotary vibration motors, the linear actuator can produce more precise and controlled haptic feedback, allowing for a wide range of sensations. The iPhone's software controls the intensity and pattern of these vibrations, enabling different types of feedback for various actions, like pressing a button, receiving a notification, or performing 3D Touch actions.
