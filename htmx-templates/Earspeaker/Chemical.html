 <span class="c0">
  designing and synthesizing new materials

 <span class="c3">
  In addition to material development, chemical engineers contribute to the
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  acoustic performance
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  of the ear speaker through the formulation of materials that aid in
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  sound dampening and waveguiding
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  . This includes
 </span>
 <span class="c0">
  creating non-conductive materials
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  that help to minimize interference and optimize the acoustic pathway within the speaker, ensuring that sound is delivered clearly and directly to the user's ear
