  The off button operates by mechanically actuating an internal switch when pressed, signaling the device's software to execute the designated power or sleep/wake functions. The design ensures a clear tactile response, indicating to the user that their input has been registered. Advanced features, such as long press or double press, are also supported, allowing for a range of functionalities beyond simply turning the device on or off.
