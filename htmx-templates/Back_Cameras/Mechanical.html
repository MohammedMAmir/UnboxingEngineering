 <span class="c3">
  Mechanical engineers are responsible for the
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  physical design and integration
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  of the camera module within the iPhone. They work on the
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  precise alignment
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  of the lens, sensor, and other components within a compact space, ensuring that the camera functions seamlessly with the rest of the device. Their work includes
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  developing mounts and stabilizing mechanisms
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  that protect the camera from
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  shocks and vibrations

<p class="c5">
 <span class="c3">
  For iPhones featuring
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  optical zoom,
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  mechanical engineers design the intricate
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  zoom mechanism
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  that allows the
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  lens to move precisely
 </span>
 <span class="c3">
  for zooming in and out. They ensure that the mechanism is reliable, durable, and operates smoothly, providing users with the ability to capture images from various distances without compromising image quality. This involves the challenge of fitting
 </span>
 <span class="c1">
  complex mechanical systems
 </span>
 <span class="c8 c3">
  into the very limited space available within a smartphone.
